# Getting Started

To get started with BISDN Linux and baseboxd, you will need:

- a switch platform that is currently supported
- a serial connection to the switch (until you have installed everything and
  are able to use ssh to connect)
- some understanding of configuring networks with iproute2 AND/OR
  systemd-networkd
- a basic understanding of Linux in general

If you have all the things mentioned above ready and are eager to start, you
should continue to [Connecting To The Switch](/getting_started/connecting_to_the_switch.md)
