# FRRouting

FRRouting, or FRR, is a routing agent for Linux/Unix platforms, that aggregates several routing daemons, like bgpd and ospfd.

Currently FRR support in baseboxd, is only tested with bgpd and ospfd, and a few configuration examples can be seen in the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), BGPv6 (Border Gateway Protocol for IPv6 networks), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and OSPFv3 (Open Shortest Path First for IPv6 networking) sections. Installing FRR can be done, on Fedora and CentOS distributions, by enabling the BISDN FRR COPR repository, available [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bisdn/frr/), or the testing version [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bisdn/frr-testing/)).
