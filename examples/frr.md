FRRouting
=========

FRRouting, or FRR, is a routing agent for Linux/Unix plaforms, that aggregates several routing daemons, like bgpd and ospfd. 

Currently FRR support in baseboxd, is only tested with bgpd and ospfd, and a few configuration examples can be seen in the :ref:`bgp`, :ref:`bgp6`, :ref:`ospf` and :ref:`ospfv3` sections. Installing FRR can be done, on Fedora and CentOS distributions, by enabling the BISDN FRR copr repository, available `here <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bisdn/frr/>`_, or the testing version `here <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bisdn/frr-testing/)>`_.
