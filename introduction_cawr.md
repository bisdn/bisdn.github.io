# CAWR
CAWR – which stands for Capability AWare Routing – is
a supplemental shim OpenFlow controller that creates a
giant switch abstraction from a set of whitebox switches.
This giant switch smoothly integrates with Baseboxd and
lets you scale your effective switch capacity. It implements
multi-path routing and supports multichassis link aggregation.
CAWR combines a scalable data center switching
solution with high availability.

The CAWR controller (Capability AWare Routing) is an OpenFlow controller that creates a ‘giant
switch’ abstraction. It is an optional shim controller for the control of multiple switches.
